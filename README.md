Hi!üëã This is a secured Movies Recommendation Web Application. Based on your past choices and behavior it will suggest five movies. And also you can check out top TV Shows. 

A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users‚Äô film preferences based on their past choices and behavior. It‚Äôs an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts the possible movie choices of the concerned user and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.

Dependencies :

- Jupyter Notebook 
- Text Vectorization(B0W)
- cosine-similarity
- scikit-learn 1.0.2
- streamlit 1.14.0
- Python 3.10.0
- nltk 3.6.7
- Pandas
- Numpy

Install dependencies using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

steps :  "DataCollectionüóÇÔ∏è", "Preprocessingüë®‚Äçüíª", "Model Buildü§ñ", "Website Buildüåê", "DeploymentüéØ"

- DataSet is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- Build the model using [Text Vectorization](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-vectorization-bag-of-words-bow-441d1bfce897) ( Bags of words) technique.
- Website build using [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) and [streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/).
- Then Application is deployed in [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) cloud server
